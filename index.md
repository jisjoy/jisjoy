I have comprehensive experience in Strategic ERP/CRM Planning, Information Systems Management & IT Infrastructure Deployment. Founded on a solid functional grounding in Business Systems & System Administration followed by senior IT roles and Implementation assignments across a range of Retail, Distribution & Manufacture industries. Hence, I wanted to be working in IT industry. Specially work with end user supports.
Currently, I don’t have any qualification or certification in Information technology. The reason being to join the course to get a bachelor certification in information technology. Also, I wanted to learn the developer skills as well as more knowledge about on Information technology.

To the ERP/CRM user functional support, required only an experience. However, to develop the Business intelligent reports or develop web applications required a proper qualifications and experience.

Project Ideas

Project Overview
I am really passionate about the Information Technology. The project is an individual or collaborative enterprise that is carefully planned to achieve a particular aim.

a project is a series of tasks that need to be completed in order to reach a specific outcome. A project can also be defined as a set of inputs and outputs required to achieve a particular goal. Projects can range from simple to complex and can be managed by one person or a hundred.


Normal project has five phases,
1.Project Initiation.
2.Project Planning. 
3.Project Execution. 
4.Project Monitoring and Control.
5.Project Closure.

Motivations
Learn more things about your project that is important. First you have to select the latest domain for your project. Then developing projects in new technology and implementing innovative ideas and technique in your projects that makes project more interesting. Team work is the main thing for a good project.

Description

Organization’s motivations for ERP implementation can be classified into two groups, technological and operational.

Technological motives relate mainly to:

Replacement of an unintegrated system,
Improvement of quality and accessibility of information,
Integration of business processes and the supporting systems,
Simplification of integration of business acquisitions into the existing technology infrastructure,
Replacement of older and obsolete systems, and
Acquirement of system that can support business growth.
Operational motives, on the other hand, are related to:

Improving inadequate business performance,
Reducing high-cost structures,
Improving responsiveness to customers,
Simplifying ineffective, complex business processes,
Supporting new business strategies,
Expanding business globally, and
Standardising business process throughout the enterprise.
There are many good reasons why organisations should adopt ERP system.

Some of them are listed next.

Responsiveness:  In today’s business, the speed of an organisation to respond to business requirements can be very vital. With its single database systems and integrated module, ERP systems enable an organization to make faster and better decisions based on accurate and up-to-date information.

Maintenance cost : The only alternative to the ERP systems is to keep a large number of unintegrated systems, which support various business functions or business process. Maintaining these systems is, of course, very costly, because each system requires a different maintenance programme and different skills.

Operational cost : In an unintegrated systems environment, the data must be entered for each system. Each system may require a different format, which in turn requires data transformation. This “multiple entry” not only costs organisations much more, but also becomes a potential danger for data integrity.

Business process improvement : Since the rise of ERP, many organisations have undertaken business reengineering (BPR) initiatives accompanied by ERP systems implementation, which have led to the invention of the term “ERP-enabled BPR.”

Tools Technologies

Business intelligent (BI) tools is very important with ERP implementations. BI tools are typically leveraged by analysts for high level discussions which involve strategic decisions. A BI tool accesses all of the data in your data warehouse, both strategic (revenue, profit and growth), and operational (daily sales performance). BI tools enable you to conduct in-depth analyses to generate comprehensive information that can deliver high-level insights. Essentially, BI is a step towards the Holy Grail of information.


Here are couple of BI tools. 

1.	Power BI 
2.	SSRS
3.	Crystal reports
4.	Qlickview BI
5.	Cognos reporting

Skills Required

 Common skills which are required to pursue a career in Business Intelligence and Analytics include.

Software languages like,C,C++,Java,etcc..
Web application developments 
SQL Programming
Problem Solving Techniques
Data collection and Management
Data Warehouse concepts
Understanding of different data sources and transaction applications
Domain and business knowledge
Ability to understand Business Model and plotting KPI’s to help organizations making successful decisions
Communication skill to converse with business users
Knowledge of upcoming BI technologies and tools like Sisense
Knowledge of SQL Programming is the basic requirement to perform analytical reporting and business intelligence. This is required to fetch the data in BI reports from Relational database and to perform the data validation from Data Warehouse. Using SQL, you can compare the values which are coming in BI reports against different KPI’s.

Outcome 

The outcome of the successful ERP project will be organisational performance, internal efficiency, competitiveness & profitability.

ERP can solve business issues like, Communication challenges, repetive manual tasks, customer data tracking, financial disorder & decision making.
